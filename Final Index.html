<h1>Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
    <p1><p>Once upon a time there lived a little country girl, <br />the prettiest creature who was ever seen.<br /> Her mother had a little red riding hood made for her.<br /> Everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.<br /></p>
    <P>One day her mother said to her:<br /><q>Go my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.</q><br /></P>
<P>Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately.</P>
<p><q>I am going to see my grandmother.</q></p>
<p><q>Does she live far off?</q> said the wolf.</p>
<P><q>It is beyond that mill you see there.</q></P>
<p>It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman<span>'</span>s house. He knocked at the door.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap.</p>
